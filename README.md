A repository of deep learning examples.

## Getting Started

- Use your [local GPU machine](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector), or get the GPUs you need in [Lambda Cloud](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud)
- Follow the instructions in the examples README.md

## Examples

- [YoloV5](yolov5/)
        - `cd yolov5`
        - `git clone git@github.com:ultralytics/yolov5.git`
        - Install YoloV5 requirements.txt
        - Run `python main.py` to download WiderFace data from HuggingFace. You can then use YoloV5 training/inference CLI as expected.
